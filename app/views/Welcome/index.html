			<p>The 2004 Residential Tenancies act gives every landlord and
				tenant a right to a rent review once each year.</p>
			<p>The Act makes it illegal for a landlord to charge a rent
				higher than the market rent.</p>
			<p>If there is a dispute about the market rent, either the
				landlord or the tenant can take a case to the Private Residential
				Tenancies Board (the PTRB).</p>
			<p>The problem with this system is in establishing an objective
				way of determining the market rent of a property.</p>
			<p>The purpose of myrent is to gather information on rents from
				landlords and tenants and allow any registered user to generate a
				report on the state of the rental market.</p>
			<p>The success of the project will depend on the willingness of
				tenants and landlords to provide information about their properties.
