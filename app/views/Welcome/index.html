	<p>The 2004 Residential Tenancies act gives every landlord and
		tenant a right to a rent review once each year.<br><br> The Act makes it
		illegal for a landlord to charge a rent higher than the market rent.<br><br>

		If there is a dispute about the market rent, either the landlord or
		the tenant can take a case to the Private Residential Tenancies Board
		(the PTRB). <br><br> The problem with this system is in establishing an
		objective way of determining the market rent of a property.<br><br> The
		purpose of myrent is to gather information on rents from landlords and
		tenants and allow any registered user to generate a report on the
		state of the rental market.<br><br> The success of the project will depend on
		the willingness of tenants and landlords to provide information about
		their properties.<br></p>
